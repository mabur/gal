* Take small steps closer to standard.
* Write paper about it.
  - Explain design choices:
    - memory layout, storage order, row-major column-major
    - array vs matrix
    - value semantics
    - modularity
    - operator [] and () and "at"?
* Compare to:
  - boost::multi-array.
  - array_view.
  - Eigen.
* Compare:
  - use case.
  - syntax.
  - run-time.
* Try to look into the standard group that works with array_view.
* Try to get into boost.
* Try to use it at work.
